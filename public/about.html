<h1 style="color:brown;">About Me</h1>
<p style="color:whitesmoke;">My name is Varun A. I'm a web Developer who wants to pursue coding in life (atleast for now). I find coding 
   interesting especially front end development. I feel iam more creative so developing websites would definitely be fun.
</p>
<p style="color:whitesmoke;">besides that I also like to game and always wondered how these amazing games are made, so game development 
   is in my to-do list.
